    "text": "Critical Family History of Colin M. Madland, uninvited settler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI study and work as an uninvited guest on the traditional lands of the Lekwungen-speaking peoples on whose traditional territory the University of Victoria stands, and I am grateful for the hospitality of the Songhees, Esquimalt and WSÁNEĆ peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.\n\n\n\n\n\nContemporary ‘Western’ research paradigms are grounded in the assumptions of white colonialists and settlers and are fundamentally at odds with the First Peoples Principles of Learning (First Peoples Principles of Learning, 2008; Held, 2019; Reason & Bradbury, 2001). Smith (2000) discusses some of the events that have led to the current reality that Indigenous Peoples are the most researched people on earth, yet much of the research has been done on or about Indigenous Peoples and communities, with researchers figuratively parachuting into communities, administering surveys without consulting Elders, then taking the data back to their offices and weaponizing it against Indigenous communities in the form of oppressive governmental policies or releasing xenophobic publications that perpetuate myths about Indigenous Peoples. Lambert (2018) argues that research in Indigenous contexts must be conducted “by and with and for” Indigenous communities if it is going to be socially and ethically just for Indigenous Peoples.\nIn doing the work of responding to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, 2015) and improving educational attainment outcomes for Indigenous communities and people, researchers have an obligation to approach Indigenous communities as sovereign nations and as equals in the process. This presentation will offer and model one of several key characteristics of Indigenous/Indigenist research involving both Indigenous and non-Indigenous partners (Smith, 2000). In engaging in Indigenist research, it is imperative that the non-Indigenous researcher acknowledge their role in the ongoing colonization of Indigenous Peoples and how that fact influences the research relationship and express a commitment to reconciliation and Indigenous self-determination.\n\n\n\nIt is easy for contemporary Canadians to think that the days of settler colonialism are long over and we bear no responsibility in the ongoing oppression of Indigenous nations in Canada, but this view ignores the fact that the public and private infrastructure that Canadians have built was built on stolen Indigenous land and that those of us whose ancestors settled or homesteaded in Canada were gifted land that was stolen by the Crown from Indigenous Peoples.\nSleeter (2016) engaged in a critical family history project and provided a template that others may use. They found that, along with the rise of web applications and software designed for amateur genealogists to trace their family histories, there has been a trend for ‘white’ (I use this term acknowledging that ‘whiteness’ extends beyond phenotype) or dominant social groups to focus solely on exploring their own family history, while ignoring the greater social context in which their ancestors lived. Conversely, members of minority groups were more likely to connect their family histories to the history of systemic oppression their ancestors experienced.\nThis tendency can lead to a kind of erasure, where the family histories of the dominant group ignore or minimize the role that oppressive government policies have played in their ongoing success and material wealth. It is precisely this erasure of oppression that makes it difficult for many settlers to acknowledge their privilege and their ongoing role in the oppression of minority groups. Engaging in the process of a critical family history is an important first step for settler researchers to acknowledge their role in the research and to more fully understand the implications of a commitment to reconciliation and Indigenous self-determination.\nUsing online genealogy software to trace ancestral lineage is an accessible, though time-consuming, approach for amateur genealogists to learn about when and where their ancestors originated, and when and where they settled in what is now known as North America. Using this information, it is possible to use census data, land titles, and published wills to trace the transfer of land stolen from Indigenous nations and given to colonial settlers, often for a fraction of its monetary value, and always with no regard for its spiritual value or its role in the lives and identities of Indigenous Peoples. This data may also be aligned with known dates of the initiation of governmental policies that encouraged and enabled the seizure of land from Indigenous Nations. Further, by tracing land titles and archived wills, Sleeter was able to trace the transfer of wealth from specific Indigenous nations to her ancestors and ultimately to her personally.\n\n\n\nIn the fall of 2019, I engaged in a Sleeter-inspired critical family history focusing on the emigration of my father’s grandfather who left Norway as a young man and eventually homesteaded in central Alberta. This paper and timeline will detail what I learned about my family history, and how I have connected my history with the social and political events of the times when Ole Madland emigrated from Norway and ended up in New Westminster, BC.\nAs this is a self-study with my ancestors as (unwitting) participants, my position in it is central. I was both the participant and the audience for the project. Sources of information (data) were various government archival websites, my father, and the collective work of other family members contributing to an online genealogical tool called geni.com. As Sleeter (2016) observes, most members of dominant social groups tend to focus only on their own families in tracing lineage. I found that this was difficult to avoid because there is simply no mention of Indigenous Peoples in any of the documents that I discovered and examined related to my family’s history. It took a purposeful decision on my part to try to align my family history with events in the politics of Indigenous-Canadian relations. In the end, though, it is clear that my great grandfather left Norway, likely encouraged by emigration recruiters, at a time when many of his fellow Norwegians were doing the same. They all left Norway because of the difficulty of farming in a land that grows mostly rocks, lured by the promise of free and bountiful land in North America. Their way was both literally and metaphorically cleared by the enactment of laws and the deployment of the military in North America which erased Indigenous Peoples from the land, sometimes through deadly force, but regularly, and still today, through callous indifference and neglect.\nThis being a critical family history, I engaged in an exploration of what actually happened and I uncovered actual historical documents which attest to the sequence of events that led to my own personal privilege and comfort today. All of this with the goal of moving towards what Kemmis et al. (2014) call a more rational, sustainable, and just perspective as I move into my PhD dissertation project. By understanding clearly the reason that I am here, I am more able to approach research with Indigenous partners from a place of humility and reconciliation.\nAs I was working through my project, I came to understand Tuck (2009)‘s concept of “mutual understanding” and its importance in participatory action research, and also the unique way that this self-study has led to greater mutual understanding. It may seem curious that a self-study can lead to mutual understanding, but one of the themes I noticed in my project was the presence of silent voices. I had a conversation with a Stó:lô elder about my plan to engage in a critical family history project, and she asked what that meant. When I explained the process of aligning one’s own ancestral history with the social and political happenings of the time, she exclaimed “Oh, we do that all the time!” By engaging in this self-study, I have been catching up. Indigenous people already know all of this. They are reminded of it every day that they see an uninvited settler in their territory. Prior to this project, I could give lip service to ’my ancestors’ in the abstract, but now, I know, with concrete documentation, that a very specific person in history followed the spirit of his day and set out to find a better life and was only able to do that because of the dispossession of the Dakota in 1862, the Cree and Métis in Treaty 6 in 1876, and the Coast Salish, who are still without a treaty. Working towards mutual understanding requires a large amount of work for settlers to catch up to Indigenous people. It requires listening to the silent roar of Indigenous voices desperate for justice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis timeline is far from complete or comprehensive, and some dates are approximations. It does, however, tell the beginnings of a story; a story that I hope will one day lead to greater understanding, more people making commitments to reconciliation, and to Indigenous self-determination.",

It specifies the boundaries of these colonies and specifically sets aside the land west of the “Proclamation Line” to be for Indigenous Peoples. White settlers were not permitted to settle west of the line. It also specifies that land could only be purchased from the British Crown after it had been ceded by Indigenous nations. Indigenous people consider the Proclamation to be the first Aboriginal Charter of Rights because it so clearly specifies the same (Fenge & Aldridge, 2015) .",

    "text": "1862 - Dakota War\nWhile the Indian Removal Act of 1830 laid the foundation for Indigenous genocide, there were many subsequent conflicts between Indigenous Peoples trying to defend themselves and the US Military. The Dakota War of 1862 is an example where the Dakota nation (also known as Sioux) were forced into desperation by the unjust treaty violations by the US government leading to the Dakota not having enough food and going hungry. They responded by attacking settlers in the area, killing some and driving many away. This ultimately led to the largest mass execution in US history where 38 Dakota men were publicly hanged in Mankato, Minnesota.\nI include this event because it was only about 30 years prior to the arrival of Ole Madland to the exact same land that was stolen from the Dakota. As far as I can tell, Ole did not stay in this area for long and did not own any land.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‎Scene on Radio: Little War on the Prairie (Seeing White, Part 5) Rebroadcast on Apple Podcasts",

The goal of the Government was to enable the assimilation of Indigenous Peoples into white Canadian society by ‘encouraging’ them to take up sedentary, agrarian lifestyles (Whitehouse, 2008).\nThese treaties were signed while the Indigenous People were experiencing significant hardship from smallpox, tuberculosis, and hunger due to bison being over-hunted.

    "text": "May 27, 2024\nUniversity of the Fraser Valley\nFaculty Search Committee\nRE: Letter of support for the position of Assistant Professor, Teacher Education in the School of Education (Job Number J0424-1125)\nI am pleased to offer this letter of support for Colin Madland in his application to the position of Assistant Professor in Teacher Education. Colin is a mature student who is working full-time, raising a family, and is currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Educational Technology area of the Department of Curriculum and Instruction at the University of Victoria. Colin’s research focus is technology-integrated assessment practices in higher education. I strongly believe Colin is exceptional across all the criteria for this competition, namely: his contributions to the scholarly community through knowledge mobilization, publications, and community-engaged scholarship; his record of innovative teaching in large-enrolment, superdiverse undergraduate courses at the University of Victoria; his service to the educational community; and his record of awards, scholarships and grants.\n\nKnowledge Mobilization, Publications, & Community-Engaged Scholarship\nColin’s research is significant as it focuses on the intersection of faculty assessment practices and what researchers know about the measurement of student learning, an area which has come under increased scrutiny as universities have been forced by SARS-CoV-2 and generative artificial intelligence tools to reconsider traditional assessment practices. Colin’s research has provided insight into how instructors typically engage with technology in assessment, which has led to the development of a framework to explain the importance of socially just and Indigenist approaches to assessment. Colin has three peer-reviewed journal articles, 19 peer-reviewed national and international conference presentations (e.g., AERA, CSSHE and OTESSA at Congress, International Council on Distance Education, Association for Learning Technologies, Open Education Conference), plus 18 professional higher education conferences. He is an active reviewer of peer-reviewed journal submissions in the field of open and online learning.\n\n\nInnovative Undergraduate Teaching\nColin has taught multiple high-enrolment sections of EDCI 335, EDCI 338 and EDCI 339 as a sessional instructor at UVic. These courses often attract a superdiverse student body from across the UVic community and Colin excels at ensuring equity of opportunity for each learner. Colin’s approach to teaching is highly innovative as he incorporates modern web-authoring tools such as WordPress into the structure of his courses. Colin goes out of his way to provide collegial support for other Ph.D. and M.A. students and sessional instructors in our area. He participated in a very successful co-design and co-teach project with a fellow Ph.D. student, which led to the creation of a sustainable and extensible body of course materials. He is very collaborative in approaching his work and has extended this into support for the broader UVic community through three presentations in the “Let’s Talk about Teaching” conference offered through Learning and Teaching Support and Innovation (LTSI).\n\n\nService to the Community and/or Professional Activities and Affiliations\nIn addition to his academic success, Colin has been a practitioner in the educational technology community and has been very active in presenting at regional, national, and international conferences. Much of his recent work has been focused on improving understanding of technology-integrated assessment and advocating for more socially just and Indigenist approaches to assessment. His previous work focussed on the use of open education resources (OER) in higher education with a strong emphasis on increasing access to higher education for people who might otherwise be unable to participate. Colin is well-respected in the educational technology community in British Columbia and his most recent position, as Manager of Online Learning and Instructional Technologies at Trinity Western University (TWU), is focused on leading TWU in the development of a robust, flexible, and extensible technological infrastructure to support the differentiated dissemination of course materials to underserved populations in Canada as well as diverse international branch campuses of TWU. Under Colin’s leadership, his team was recognized with a Team Award for their work assisting the campus pivot to remote learning.\nAdditionally, he is a founding board member and the past-chair of the graduate student committee of Open/Technology in Education, Society, and Scholarship Association (OTESSA), a scholarly association that is a member of the Federation of the Humanities and Social Sciences in Canada. He was a key support as co-chair of the inaugural OTESSA Conference at Congress, which pivoted to a flexible format due to COVID-19 with an emphasis on asynchronous presentations and publication of conference proceedings/full papers. He was also part of the communications committee in creating this organization dedicated to bringing together researchers, practitioners, and administrators in the field of educational technology and open education/scholarship. Previously, he served two years as a board member representing researchers of the Canadian Network for Innovation in Education (CNIE).\n\n\nAwards, Scholarships, & Grants\nSince joining the University of Victoria, Colin has been awarded a BCcampus Student Research Fellowship ($6000) and UVic graduate student scholarships of $5000 each in each of his two years of course-work (totaling $10,000). His application to the University of Victoria was strengthened by his academic achievements as a Masters student at Athabasca University which culminated with him being nominated for and receiving the Athabasca University Tim Byrne Memorial Scholarship ($1000) for academic excellence along with an outstanding thesis or project in June 2014. During his time at Thompson Rivers University, he was awarded $5000 from the TRU Open Learning Presentation Fund and was an Open Education Resources Research Fellow ($5000 USD). In total he has been awarded over $27,800. Colin has a consistent pattern of achievement and is unwavering in his work ethic. He ranks in the top 1% for academic communication, critical thinking, and research abilities. Colin completed his candidacy in the summer of 2021.\nIn closing, I strongly endorse Colin for the position of Assistant Professor of Teacher Education and hope the selection committee can support him as he moves into a tenure-track role. He is an exceptional student and I cannot overstate how deserving he is of this position.\nSincerely,\nDr. Valerie Irvine Co-Director, TIE Research Lab Department of Curriculum and Instruction"

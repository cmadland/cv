# Instructions for Requesting Letters of Recommendation from Colin Madland.

I write many letters for a number of types of positions for people I have known in various ways.  I want to do this in a top quality way and minimize the chance of errors on your part or mine while maximizing a successful outcome for both of us.

Please follow these instructions carefully if you would like me to write a letter for you.   If you follow these instructions carefully, including giving me all requested materials, it is likely that I can turn around your request in a couple of weeks.

Specific Instructions: Please cut and paste items from this page into a document or email and send it back to me.

- Your full name:

- First name you prefer to go by:

- Pronouns you use to describe yourself:

- Tell me what profession/position/program you are applying for:

- What is the due date for this letter?

-  What is your major(s) and minor(s)?

- Are you a first-generation university student (first in your family to go to university in Canada or the U.S.)?

- From a rural area or under resourced area? If so, where? What challenges did this pose for you if any?

- What courses did you take with me and what semester? What were your grades?  
    - *Copy and paste unofficial grades, preferably showing what you took each term. I like to see this because it allows me to see what else you took while you took my class. I may be able to speak about a really challenging semester for you.*

- Give me a paragraph telling me what specific aspects of your association with me you would like me to elaborate on in the letter. Describe situations where I observed the traits/attributes that you expect me to describe in the letter.   
    - *(Examples: We had a great chat during office hours about the development of your critical thinking skills in independent research, you worked on a mission trip abroad where you demonstrated your fundamental caring for others about which we talked at length, we worked together on a committee where you demonstrated your collaborative spirit and your adherence to detail and deadlines).*   If you can’t think of interactions where you demonstrated attributes of value in a recommendation, it’s unlikely I will be able to.

- What was the most meaningful, non-academic experience you had that taught you about the diversity of ideas/people different from you?

-  What should I emphasize for you, considering that you may have other letter writers that will emphasize other areas? This is also a good time to let me know if you want me to include a description about a hardship or personal attribute you faced that gives context to your application. (For example, if you had a family issue that affected your studies or if you had to work harder than others because of your background, etc.)


- Please paste your personal statement in here (single spaced) from your application if there is one. A rough draft is fine, I am looking to get to know you better and see what else accompanies your application:

 

- Please summarize here where I will be sending or uploading my letter to.

If you need to put information into a portal about me here is my information:

***Note: Be sure to sign the line that indicates you WAIVE your right of access to the letter.  If you do not waive your rights to read the letter and forms, then the honesty of the letter will be in doubt.  The letters and forms have little credibility if they are not confidential.

 

I’ll need you to email me if you have not heard from me by the agreed upon due date. Do not hesitate to send me a reminder one week before it is due because everyone likes reminders to stay on track!


Keep in touch and let me know about your success! I love to hear from students years later too, it’s the big reward of being a teacher. Don’t forget about me when you are so successful!

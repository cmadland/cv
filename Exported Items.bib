  abstract = {The process of earning a doctoral degree is arduous and challenging and has been described as a cognitive apprenticeship whereby experienced researchers provide mentorship and coaching for their students. This presentation will show how two doctoral students and their supervisor formed a rich community of practice in the context of designing and teaching an undergraduate course. Implications for online learning for both doctoral students in their programs and also in the online design and delivery of undergraduate courses are discussed.},
